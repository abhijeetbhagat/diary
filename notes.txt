*Visual Studio (2013)*
Regex search includes including files starting with 'ipp'- #include\s["<]ipp

*Dumpbin*

*Intel Performance Primitives library*
Build a C++ project with IPP library (v.2019) -

*Recommendation system* 
  - co-occurence matrix (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/lecture/CdmdR/collaborative-filtering-people-who-bought-this-also-bought)
  - count-min-sketch algo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibxXO-b14j4)

*C++*
- Iterating over "const char*" is different than std::string("string") in a range-based for loop.
- asserting can be done using the 'assert' macro from cassert header.

*Networking*
- Nagle's algo : solves the 'small packet problem' by accumulating bytes and sending them in a single packet instead of individual packets. e.g. telnet
- Jitter : inter-arrival packet time. Solved using buffering at the receiving end.
- A rate-limiter (throttling requests bursts for an API) can be implemented using the leaky bucket algo.

*Streaming*
- Dish TV uses MPEG-4 codec with encryption for video.
